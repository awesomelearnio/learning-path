# Contributing to Awesome Learn

Thank you for your interest in contributing! 🎉  

Awesome Learn is a community-driven project that provides **structured learning paths** with minimal, high-quality, curated recommendations.

We welcome contributions that improve clarity, correctness, depth, or structure — and we are always open to new learning paths that follow the project's philosophy.

## What We're Looking For

- New learning paths that follow the official template.
- Improvements to existing learning paths (clarity, organization, corrections).
- Minimal, high-quality resource recommendations (books, courses, docs).
- Practice materials, exercises, and project suggestions.
- Fixes for outdated links, broken URLs, or incorrect information.
- Contributions that make learning easier, clearer, and more structured.

## Contribution Guidelines

### **1. Follow the Learning Path Template**

All new learning paths must follow the template in `README.md`.

This ensures a consistent structure across the Awesome Learn ecosystem.

### 2. Keep It Minimal & Curated

Awesome Learn is **not** a link dump or giant resource list.

For each learning path:

- Prefer **fewer, better** recommendations.  
- Avoid long lists of tools, links, or articles.  
- Suggest at most:
  - **~3 core books**.
  - **~3–5 core courses / videos**.
- Prefer official documentation and well-maintained sources.  
- Only include resources that genuinely move the learner forward.

### 3. Writing Style

Please write in a style that is:

- Clear and beginner-friendly.  
- Neutral and objective (no hype or marketing tone).  
- Concise (no unnecessary filler).  
- Consistent with the rest of the project.  

Avoid:

- Heavy jargon without explanation.  
- Overly academic or overly informal language.  
- Personal rants or strong opinions.  

### 4. Link & Resource Requirements

All included resources must:

- Be publicly accessible (no login-only or opaque paywalls unless exceptional).  
- Use direct URLs (no shortened links, no trackers).
- Avoid affiliate, referral, or commercial tracking codes.  
- Be relevant, high-quality, and reasonably up-to-date.  

We **do not accept**:

- Affiliate links.  
- Referral links.  
- Obvious self-promotion without clear learning value.  

### 5. Submitting Your Contribution

1. **Fork** the repository.  
2. **Create a new branch** for your changes.  
3. Update or add content following the template and guidelines.  
4. Ensure Markdown formatting is clean and consistent.  
5. Run a quick spell-check and sanity-check your links.  
6. **Open a Pull Request** with:
   - A clear title.  
   - A short description of what you changed and why.  

A maintainer will review your PR and may request adjustments before merging.
