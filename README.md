# Learning Path Template  

*A reusable template for creating structured learning paths in the Awesome Learn ecosystem.*

This repository serves as the **official template** for authors creating new learning paths.  

Using this template ensures all learning paths remain consistent, clear, and easy for learners to follow.

Click **"Use this template"** above to generate a new repository based on this structure.

## Structure of a Learning Path

A learning path should guide a learner from **beginner → intermediate → advanced**, using clear steps and minimal, high-quality resources.

Below is the complete template.

Replace everything in `{curly brackets}` with content specific to your topic.

## {Name of Learning Path}

A concise introduction to the topic. Explain *what* it is and *why* it matters.

Example:  
"Python is a versatile programming language used in web development, automation, data science, AI, and more. This learning path provides a structured approach for beginners through advanced learners."

## History & Context (Optional)

A short section explaining the origin or evolution of the topic.

Keep it **brief** and **useful**, not overly academic.

Example:  
"Python was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum with a focus on readability and simplicity. Over time, it grew into one of the most widely used languages in the world."

## Components of the Topic

List and briefly describe the major components, pillars, or sub-areas someone needs to understand.

Example:

- **Syntax & Language Basics** – variables, data types, control flow.  
- **Standard Library** – built-in modules and tools.  
- **Ecosystem & Tools** – package managers, environments.  
- **Core Applications** – web, data, automation, AI.  

Use bullet points, not long paragraphs.

## Learning Path Overview

A high-level roadmap of the stages a learner will go through.

Example:

1. **Foundations** – basic concepts and terminology.  
2. **Core Skills** – the essential skills for real-world use.  
3. **Intermediate Topics** – deeper knowledge and broader context.  
4. **Advanced Concepts** – specialized or high-level topics.  
5. **Practice & Projects** – applying what they've learned.  

## Step-by-Step Learning Path

### 1. Foundations

Introduce the basics a new learner must understand.

Keep it short and clear.

### 2. Core Skills

Describe the main concepts they need to develop competence.

### 3. Intermediate Knowledge

Add deeper concepts that expand understanding.

### 4. Advanced Topics

Highlight specialized or complex areas for mastery.

### 5. Practice & Projects

Provide suggestions for exercises, challenges, or real-world projects.

## Recommended Books

List **up to 3** books that are genuinely helpful and widely respected.

```markdown
- *{Book Title 1}* – {1–2 sentence explanation}
- *{Book Title 2}* – {1–2 sentence explanation}
- *{Book Title 3}* – {1–2 sentence explanation}
```

## Recommended Courses

List **3–5** high-quality courses, tutorials, or video series.

Prefer free or publicly accessible content when possible.

Example:

- {Course 1} – {short explanation}  
- {Course 2} – {short explanation}  
- {Course 3} – {short explanation}  

Avoid long lists or low-quality tutorials.

## External Resources

Include **only the most essential** external references.

Avoid large link lists.

Examples:

- {Official Documentation}  
- {Important Tool or Library}  
- {Cheat Sheet or Quick Reference}  

All links must be public, high-quality, and non-promotional.

## Practice & Project Ideas

Provide actionable ways for learners to apply their knowledge.

Examples:

- Build a {project idea}.  
- Complete a challenge using {concept}.  
- Recreate a simple version of {application/tool}.  
- Automate {task or workflow}. 

Keep ideas simple, clear, and beginner-friendly.

## Tools & Ecosystem (Optional)

List essential tools commonly used in this domain.

Examples:

- Package managers (e.g., {pip}, {npm}, {cargo}).  
- CLI tools.  
- Popular frameworks or environments.  
- Debugging or development tools.  

Do **not** include exhaustive lists — only the core items someone must know.

## What to Learn Next

Suggest natural follow-up topics once the learner completes this path.

Examples:

- "After learning {topic}, consider studying {related topic}."  
- "A great next step is exploring {framework/tool}."  
- "Deepen your skills by learning {advanced concept}."  

This section helps learners continue their journey with direction.
